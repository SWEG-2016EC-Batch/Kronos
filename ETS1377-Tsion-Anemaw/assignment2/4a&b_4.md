▎Step 1: Start

    • Begin the program.

▎Step 2: Outer Loop Initialization

    • Initialize an outer loop with i starting from 1 and continuing while i is less than or equal to 5. This loop controls the number of rows.

▎Step 3: Print Leading Spaces

    • Inside the outer loop, initialize another inner loop with h starting from 5 - i and continuing while h is greater than 0. This loop prints leading spaces to align the numbers to the right.

  • For each iteration of i:

    • Calculate the number of spaces as 5 - i.

    • Print a space character (" ").

▎Step 4: Print Numbers in Descending Order

    • After printing the spaces, initialize a second inner loop with j starting from i and continuing while j is greater than or equal to 1. This loop prints numbers in descending order.

    • For each iteration of this inner loop:

    • Print the current value of j.

▎Step 5: New Line After Each Row

    • After completing both inner loops (spaces and numbers), print a newline character (endl) to move to the next line.

▎Step 6: Increment Outer Loop Variable

    • Increment i by 1 (this happens automatically due to the loop structure).

▎Step 7: End Outer Loop

    • Once i exceeds 5, exit the outer loop.

▎Step 8: End

    • Terminate the program.
