**Pseudocode:**


For each row from 1 to 5:
For each column from 1 to 5:
Print the column number with a space
Print a newline

**Explanation:**

This pseudocode will print a 5x5 matrix of numbers from 1 to 5 in each row. 

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Outer Loop:**
   - Iterates 5 times, representing each row of the matrix.
2. **Inner Loop:**
   - Iterates 5 times for each outer loop iteration, representing each column in a row.
3. **Print:**
   - Prints the current column number followed by a space.
4. **Newline:**
   - After each inner loop completes, prints a newline character to move to the next row.

This will result in the following output:


1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
