# Pseudocode for Printing a Character Square

## Input
- Prompt the user to enter a number n.
- Read the value of n from user input.

## Output
- Print a square of characters starting from 'A', filling each position with consecutive uppercase letters.

## Operations
BEGIN

    // Declare integer variable n
    DECLARE n AS INTEGER
    
    // Declare character variable character initialized to 'A'
    DECLARE character AS CHAR = 'A'
    
    // Prompt the user for input
    PRINT "please enter n:"
    // Read the value of n from user input
    READ n
    
    // Outer loop for each row from 1 to n
    FOR i FROM 1 TO n DO
        
        // Inner loop for each column from 1 to n
        FOR j FROM 1 TO n DO
            
            // Check if character is an uppercase letter
            IF isupper(character) THEN
                
                // Print the current character with leading space
                PRINT " " + character + " "
                
                // Increment the character to the next uppercase letter
                character = character + 1
            
            END IF
            
        END FOR
        
        // Print a new line after finishing the row
        PRINT a new line
    
    END FOR

    RETURN 0 // End of the program

END
