# Pseudocode for Printing Characters in a Grid

## Input
- No explicit input is required for this program.

## Output
- Print a grid of characters starting from 'A', with each row containing 6 characters.

## Operations
BEGIN

    // Initialize the character variable to 'A'
    SET character = 'A'
    
    // Start of the main program
    FOR i FROM 1 TO 4 DO // Loop for 4 rows
        // Inner loop to print 6 characters per row
        FOR j FROM 1 TO 6 DO
            PRINT " " + character + " " // Print the current character with leading and trailing spaces
            INCREMENT character by 1 // Move to the next character in the ASCII table
        END FOR
        
        PRINT a new line // Move to the next line after finishing the row
    END FOR

    RETURN 0 // End of the program
