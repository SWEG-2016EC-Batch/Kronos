**Pseudocode:**


For each row from 1 to 4:
For each column from 1 to 6:
Print the current character with a space on both sides
Increment the character
Print a newline

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Character:**
   - Set the initial character to 'A'.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - Iterates 4 times, representing each row of the matrix.

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - Iterates 6 times for each outer loop iteration, representing each column in a row.

4. **Print Character:**
   - Prints the current character with a space on both sides.
   - Increments the character to the next alphabetical letter.

5. **Newline:**
   - After each inner loop completes, prints a newline character to move to the next row. 

This will result in the following output:

 **Output:**
-A B C D E F.
-G H I J K L.
-M N O P Q R.
-S T U V W X.
