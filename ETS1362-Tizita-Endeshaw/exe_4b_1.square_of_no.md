    // Prompt the user for input
    PRINT "please enter number of n:"
    // Read the value of n from user input
    READ n
    
    // Outer loop for each row from 1 to n
    FOR i FROM 1 TO n DO
        
        // Inner loop for each column from 1 to n
        FOR j FROM 1 TO n DO
            PRINT " " + j // Print the current number j with a leading space
        END FOR
