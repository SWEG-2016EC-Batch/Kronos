# Pseudocode for Right-Aligned Hollow Triangle Star Pattern

## Input
- No explicit input is required for this program.

## Output
- Print a right-aligned hollow triangle pattern of asterisks (*) with a height of 6.

## Operations
BEGIN

    // Start of the main program
    FOR i FROM 1 TO 6 DO
        // Inner loop to print leading spaces for right alignment
        FOR h FROM 6 - i DOWN TO 1 DO
            PRINT " " // Print a space
            
        END FOR
        
        // Inner loop to print stars and spaces
        FOR j FROM 1 TO i DO
            IF (i == 1 OR i == 6 OR j == 1 OR j == i) THEN
                PRINT " * " // Print an asterisk with spaces
            ELSE
                PRINT "   " // Print three spaces for hollow effect
            END IF
            
        END FOR
        
        PRINT a new line // Move to the next line after finishing the row
    END FOR

    RETURN 0 // End of the program

END
