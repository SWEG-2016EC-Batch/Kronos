pseudocode
▎Step 1: Start

    • Begin the program.

▎Step 2: Outer Loop Initialization

    • Initialize an outer loop with i starting from 1 and continuing while i is less than or equal to 5. This loop controls the number of rows that will be printed.

▎Step 3: Initialize Letter Variable

    • Inside the outer loop, initialize a character variable letter to 'A'. This means that for each iteration of the outer loop (each row), the letter will start from 'A'.

▎Step 4: Inner Loop Initialization

    • Inside the outer loop, initialize an inner loop with j starting from 1 and continuing while j is less than or equal to i. This loop controls how many letters are printed in the current row.

    • For each iteration of i:

    • The inner loop will run i times. 

▎Step 5: Print Letters

    • For each iteration of the inner loop:

    • Print the current value of letter, followed by a space.

    • Increment letter using letter++, which moves to the next character in the ASCII table.

▎Step 6: New Line After Each Row

    • After completing the inner loop (printing letters), print a newline character (endl) to move to the next line.

▎Step 7: Increment Outer Loop Variable

    • Increment i by 1 (this happens automatically due to the loop structure).

▎Step 8: End Outer Loop

    • Once i exceeds 5, exit the outer loop.

▎Step 9: End

    • Terminate the program.
