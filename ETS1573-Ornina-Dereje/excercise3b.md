pseudocode
1. Start:

       • Begin program execution.

2. Declare Variables:

       • Declare an integer variable number to store the user input.

       • Declare an integer variable numdigits.

3. User Prompt:

       • Print the message: "please enter an integer: ".

       • Read the integer value into number from user input.

4. Initialize Digit Count:

       • Set numdigits to 0, which will keep track of how many digits are in the number.

5. While Loop:

       • Start a loop that continues as long as number is greater than 0:

       • This loop will process each digit of the number.

6. Count Digits:

       • Inside the loop:

       • Divide number by 10 using integer division (number /= 10;). This operation effectively removes the last digit from number.

       • Increment the digit count using:

       • numdigits++;

7. Loop Termination:

       • The loop will terminate when number becomes 0, meaning all digits have been processed.

8. Output Result:

       • Print the total number of digits using:

       • cout << "the number of digits is: " << numdigits;

9. End:

       • Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.
