pseudocode: Print 5x5 Grid

step 1: Start

    • Begin the algorithm.

Step 2: Initialize Variables

    • Set rows = 5 (to define the number of rows in the grid).

    • Set columns = 5 (to define the number of columns in the grid).

Step 3: Outer Loop for Rows

    • For i from 1 to rows (inclusive):

    • This loop will iterate through each row of the grid.

Step 4: Inner Loop for Columns

    • For j from 1 to columns (inclusive):

    • This loop will iterate through each column in the current row.

  • Step 4.1: Print Column Number

    • Print the value of j followed by a space.

      • This displays the current column number in the grid.
  
Step 5: New Line After Each Row

    • After completing the inner loop (all columns in the current row have been printed):

    • Print a newline character (this moves the cursor to the next line for the next row).

Step 6: End Outer Loop

    • Once all rows have been processed, exit the outer loop.

Step 7: End

    • Terminate the algorithm.
