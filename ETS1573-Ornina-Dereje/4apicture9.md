pseudocode 

▎Step 1: Start

    • Begin the program.

▎Step 2: Outer Loop Initialization

    • Initialize an outer loop with i starting from 6 and continuing while i is greater than or equal to 1. This loop controls the number of rows that will be printed (total of 6 rows).

▎Step 3: Inner Loop Initialization

    • Inside the outer loop, initialize an inner loop with j starting from 1 and continuing while j is less than or equal to i. This loop controls how many characters (either asterisks or spaces) are printed in each row.

▎Step 4: Conditional Check

    • For each iteration of the inner loop, check the following condition:

    • If i is equal to 6, or i is equal to 1, or j is equal to i, or j is equal to 1, then:

    • Print an asterisk (*).

  • Else:

    • Print a space ( ).

▎Step 5: New Line After Each Row

    • After completing the inner loop (printing all characters for the current row), print a newline character (endl) to move to the next line.

▎Step 6: Decrement Outer Loop Variable

    • Decrement i by 1 (this happens automatically due to the loop structure).

▎Step 7: End Outer Loop

    • Once i is less than 1, exit the outer loop.

▎Step 8: End

    • Terminate the program.
