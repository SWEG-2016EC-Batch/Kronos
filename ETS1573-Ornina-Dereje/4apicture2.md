pseudocode: Print a 4x4 Grid of Characters

Step 1: Start

    • Begin the program.

Step 2: Initialize Character Variable

    • Declare a character variable character and initialize it with the value 'A'. This variable will be used to track which letter to print.

Step 3: Initialize the Outer Loop

    • For i from 1 to 4 (inclusive):

    • This loop represents the current row number of the grid.

Step 4: Initialize the Inner Loop

    • For j from 1 to 4 (inclusive):

    • This inner loop represents the current column number of the grid.

Step 5: Print Character

    • Inside the inner loop:

    • Print the current character surrounded by spaces (" " << character << " ").

    • After printing, increment the character variable to move to the next letter in the alphabet.

Step 6: New Line After Each Row

    • After completing the inner loop (all characters for the current row have been printed):

    • Print a newline character (endl) to move to the next line.

Step 7: End Main Loop

    • Once all rows have been processed, exit the outer loop.

Step 8: End

    • Terminate the program.
