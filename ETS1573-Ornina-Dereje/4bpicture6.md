▎pseudocode
1. Start:

       • Begin the program execution.

2. Declare Variables:

       • Declare an integer variable n to hold the number of rows and columns to print.

3. User Prompt:

       • Print the prompt message: "please enter n: ".

       • Read the integer value n from user input.

4. Outer Loop (for Rows):

       • Start a loop with variable i ranging from 1 to n (inclusive):

       • This loop controls the number of rows to be printed.

5. Initialize Letter:

       • Inside the outer loop, initialize a character variable letter to 'a'. This variable will be used to print letters starting from 'a' for each row.

6. Inner Loop (for Letters):

       • Inside the outer loop, start another loop with variable j ranging from 1 to n (inclusive):

       • This loop controls how many letters are printed in each row.

       • For each iteration of this inner loop, print the current value of letter, followed by a space (" ").

       • After printing, increment letter using letter++ to move to the next letter in the alphabet.

7. Newline:

       • After completing the inner loop (printing letters for the current row), print a newline character using cout << endl; to move to the next row.

8. End Outer Loop:

       • The outer loop continues until all rows (from 1 to n) have been printed.

9. End:

       • After finishing all iterations, return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.
