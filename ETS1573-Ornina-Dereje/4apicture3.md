pseudocode

Step 1: Start

    • Begin the program.

Step 2: Outer Loop Initialization

    • Initialize an outer loop with i starting from 1 and continuing while i is less than or equal to 5. This loop controls the number of rows.

Step 3: Inner Loop Initialization

    • Inside the outer loop, initialize an inner loop with j starting from 1 and continuing while j is less than or equal to i. This loop controls how many numbers to print in each row.

Step 4: Print Numbers

    • Inside the inner loop:

    • Print the current value of j. This will print numbers starting from 1 up to the current value of i.

Step 5: New Line After Each Row

    • After completing the inner loop (all numbers for the current row have been printed):

    • Print a newline character (endl) to move to the next line.

Step 6: Increment Outer Loop Variable

    • Increment i by 1 (this happens automatically due to the loop structure).

Step 7: End Outer Loop

    • Once i exceeds 5, exit the outer loop.

Step 8: End

    • Terminate the program.
