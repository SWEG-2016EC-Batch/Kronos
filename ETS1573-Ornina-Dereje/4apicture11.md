pseudocode: Print Left-Aligned Triangle Pattern (Reversed)

Step 1: Start

    • Begin the program.

Step 2: Initialize the Main Loop

    • For i from 6 down to 1 (inclusive):

    • This loop represents the current row number of the triangle, starting from the bottom and moving up.

Step 3: Print Leading Spaces

    • For h from 6 - i to 1 (inclusive):

    • This inner loop prints spaces to create the left alignment.

  • Step 3.1: Print Space

    • Print a space character (" ").

Step 4: Initialize Inner Loop for Asterisks

    • For j from 1 to i (inclusive):

    • This inner loop prints the asterisks for the current row.
  
Step 5: Print Asterisk

    • Print an asterisk with a leading space (" *").

Step 6: New Line After Each Row

    • After completing the inner loops (all spaces and asterisks for the current row have been printed):

    • Print a newline character (endl) to move to the next line.

Step 7: End Main Loop

    • Once all rows have been processed, exit the main loop.

Step 8: End

    • Terminate the program.
