**Algorithm: Print a Number Rectangle with User Input**

**Input:**
- `n`: Number of rows
- `m`: Number of columns

**Output:**
- A rectangular pattern of numbers based on user input

**Steps:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Display the message: `"Enter the amount of rows and columns you want, respectively"`.
   - Read integers `n` (rows) and `m` (columns) from the user.

2. **Outer Loop (Rows):**
   - For `i` from `1` to `n`:
     - Perform the following steps:

3. **Inner Loop (Columns):**
   - For `j` from `1` to `m`:
     - Print the value of `j` followed by a space.

4. **Move to the Next Row:**
   - After the inner loop ends, print a newline character to start a new row.

5. **End Program:**
   - The program terminates after printing the rectangle.
