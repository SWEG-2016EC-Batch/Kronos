Input:File size in bytes,Transmission rate in bytes per second.

Process:read input, display output,Calculate 
    
    Total Seconds,total minutes,total hours and total days
    
output: time taken

pseducod:

    step1:start
     
    step2:read input
     
    step3: calculate timetaken for days,hours, minutes and secondsas
     
    Calculate Days:
    days = Total seconde /(24*3600)

    Calculate Hours:
     hours = remaining seconds/3600

    Calculate Minutes:
    minutes = remaining seconds/60

    remaining Seconds = remaining Seconds modulus(%) 60



    step4:print Output for 

    -Days,Hours,Minutes,Seconds
step4:stop
