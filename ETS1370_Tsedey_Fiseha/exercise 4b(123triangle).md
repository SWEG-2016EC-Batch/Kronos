**Algorithm: Print a Number Triangle with User Input**

**Input:**
- `n`: Size of the triangle (number of rows)

**Output:**
- A triangle pattern of numbers based on user input

**Steps:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Display the message: `"Enter size of your triangle"`.
   - Read integer `n` from the user.

2. **Outer Loop (Rows):**
   - For `i` from `1` to `n`:
     - Perform the following steps:

3. **Inner Loop (Columns):**
   - For `j` from `1` to `i`:
     - Print the value of `j` followed by a space.

4. **Move to the Next Row:**
   - After the inner loop ends, print a newline character to start a new row.

5. **End Program:**
   - The program terminates after printing the triangle.
